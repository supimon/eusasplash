        <h2>European Medicines Agency approves the only immunotherapy for high-risk neuroblastoma, bringing hope to
            thousands of children affected by a rare and devastating form of cancer</h2>
        <p>HEMEL HEMPSTEAD, England – XX May 2017 – EUSA Pharma today announced that the European Medicines Agency (EMA)
            has approved the antibody ch14.18/CHO, Dinutuximab beta Apeiron (dinutuximab beta), for the treatment of
            high-risk neuroblastoma in patients aged 12 months and above.1 Today’s news makes dinutixumab beta the only
            approved immunotherapy in Europe for neuroblastoma and an important tool in the fight against the condition.
        </p>
        <p>
            Neuroblastoma, is the second most common solid tumour in childhood, following brain tumours2, and
            predominantly affects children under five years old3. Every year in Europe, around 1,200 children are
            diagnosed with neuroblastoma4, a rare cancer arising from neural crest cells, which are involved in the
            foetal development of the nervous system and other tissues2. Because neuroblastoma can spread very quickly,
            almost half of children are initially diagnosed at an advanced stage of their disease and are recognised
            as ‘high-risk’ and with a poor prognosis. Approval of dinutuximab beta brings new hope to these ‘high-risk’
            children who have previously received induction chemotherapy and achieved at least a partial response,
            followed by myeloablative therapy and stem cell transplantation, as well as those with history of relapsed
            or refractory neuroblastoma, with or without residual disease.1
        </p>
        <p>
            “Today’s announcement is a leap forward for the children and families affected by neuroblastoma,
            particularly those who have keenly followed the positive clinical trial results for dinutixumab beta and
            long anticipated its approval in Europe”, commented Dr Juliet Gray, Associate Professor and Consultant in
            Paediatric Oncology at University of Southampton. “As a clinician working in a highly specialised disease
            area with limited treatment options, I greatly welcome the availability of this targeted immunotherapy
            treatment that offers improved results for high-risk neuroblastoma patients used alone or in combination
            with existing therapies.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Steve Richards, CEO of the neuroblastoma charity Solving Kids’ Cancer Europe, added: “I speak to countless
            families who have simply run out of options for their child, after undergoing months or sometimes years of
            intensive chemo and radiotherapy. Access to a new, targeted treatment for high-risk neuroblastoma, which
            offers the best possible hope of survival, is unquestionably a milestone to be celebrated. Against a cruel
            disease that currently claims the lives of half its innocent victims, we have an important new weapon with
            which to defend ourselves.”

        <h3>About dinutuximab beta</h3>
        <p>
            Dinutuximab beta is a monoclonal chimeric antibody developed to target a specific antigen, GD2, on
            neuroblastoma cells. It has been investigated in clinical trials for high-risk neuroblastoma, with more
            than 1000 patients having received treatment to date. Dinutuximab beta has orphan drug designation in the
            US and EU, and EUSA plans to file the product for approval in the United States in 2017.
