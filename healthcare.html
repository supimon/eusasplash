            <h2>European Medicines Agency approves the only immunotherapy for high-risk neuroblastoma, bringing hope to
                thousands of children affected by a rare and devastating form of cancer</h2>
            <p>HEMEL HEMPSTEAD, England – XX May 2017 – EUSA Pharma today announced that the European Medicines Agency (EMA)
                has approved the antibody ch14.18/CHO, Dinutuximab beta Apeiron (dinutuximab beta), for the treatment of
                high-risk neuroblastoma in patients aged 12 months and above.<sup>1</sup> Today’s news makes dinutixumab beta the only
                approved immunotherapy in Europe for neuroblastoma and an important tool in the fight against the condition.
            </p>
            <p>
                Neuroblastoma, is the second most common solid tumour in childhood, following brain tumours<sup>2</sup>, and
                predominantly affects children under five years old<sup>3</sup>. Every year in Europe, around 1,200 children are
                diagnosed with neuroblastoma<sup>4</sup>, a rare cancer arising from neural crest cells, which are involved in the
                foetal development of the nervous system and other tissues<sup>2</sup>. Because neuroblastoma can spread very quickly,
                almost half of children are initially diagnosed at an advanced stage of their disease and are recognised
                as ‘high-risk’ and with a poor prognosis. Approval of dinutuximab beta brings new hope to these ‘high-risk’
                children who have previously received induction chemotherapy and achieved at least a partial response,
                followed by myeloablative therapy and stem cell transplantation, as well as those with history of relapsed
                or refractory neuroblastoma, with or without residual disease.<sup>1</sup>
            </p>
            <p>
                “Today’s announcement is a leap forward for the children and families affected by neuroblastoma,
                particularly those who have keenly followed the positive clinical trial results for dinutixumab beta and
                long anticipated its approval in Europe”, commented Dr Juliet Gray, Associate Professor and Consultant in
                Paediatric Oncology at University of Southampton. “As a clinician working in a highly specialised disease
                area with limited treatment options, I greatly welcome the availability of this targeted immunotherapy
                treatment that offers improved results for high-risk neuroblastoma patients used alone or in combination
                with existing therapies.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Steve Richards, CEO of the neuroblastoma charity Solving Kids’ Cancer Europe, added: “I speak to countless
                families who have simply run out of options for their child, after undergoing months or sometimes years of
                intensive chemo and radiotherapy. Access to a new, targeted treatment for high-risk neuroblastoma, which
                offers the best possible hope of survival, is unquestionably a milestone to be celebrated. Against a cruel
                disease that currently claims the lives of half its innocent victims, we have an important new weapon with
                which to defend ourselves.”

                Dinutuximab beta is a monoclonal chimeric antibody developed to target a specific antigen, GD2, on
                neuroblastoma cells. It has been investigated in clinical trials for high-risk neuroblastoma, with more
