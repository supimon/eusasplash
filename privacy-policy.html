            do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to
            our site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict

            inform you (before collecting your data) if we intend to use your data for such purposes or if we intend
            to disclose your information to any third party for such purposes. You can exercise your right to prevent
            such processing by checking certain boxes on the forms we use to collect your data. You can also exercise
            the right at any time by contacting us at corporate@eusapharma.com.
